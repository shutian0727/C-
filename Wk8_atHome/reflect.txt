1. An abstract class is a base class that defines an interface, while a concrete class is a derived class that implements that interface.  
The abstract class identifies the member functions that the class hierarchy exposes to its clients and is the gateway to testing the derived classes in its own inheritance hierarchy.  
Each concrete class gives a specific meaning to the interface.

3. I have learnt how to define a pure virtual function to create an abstract base class. I know how to implement behavior specified in a pure virtual function. 
I understand the difference between abstract class and concrete class.
